Todo:
  ☐ Hide Dock when no toolbar windows
  ☐ Check for segfaults. Possibly write auto restart script
  ☐ Check why dock sometimes doesn't render initially
  When cycling though windows, jump to the ones in the current workspace first
  Wrong geometry when initially loaded in Xorg
  Clicking app to activate feels slow. probably animations etc
